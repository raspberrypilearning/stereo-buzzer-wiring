To wire two buzzers to a Raspberry Pi Pico, you will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico
+ 2 x passive buzzers
+ 4 x socket-socket jumper wires

Take the **first buzzer** and connect the **positive** leg to **GP5** and the **negative** leg to the nearest **GND** pin.

Next, take the **second buzzer** and connect the **positive** leg to **GP10** and the **negative** leg to the nearest **GND** pin.

**Tip**: To identify the positive leg on a buzzer, look for the longest leg. You may also be able to see a **+** symbol on the top of the buzzer.
